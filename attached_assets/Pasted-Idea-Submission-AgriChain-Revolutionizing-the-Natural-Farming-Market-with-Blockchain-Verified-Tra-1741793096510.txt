Problem Statement 
Chosen Problem: 
Farmers practicing natural farming face significant challenges in finding reliable markets for their 
produce, often losing out to middlemen who exploit the lack of transparency. Consumers, on the 
other hand, are increasingly concerned about the authenticity of natural farming products but 
struggle to verify the origins and practices behind what they buy. 
Problem Analysis: 
 57% of farmers in India lack access to reliable, direct markets, making them reliant on 
intermediaries who take a significant cut of the earnings. 
 The global organic food market is valued at $180 billion and is projected to grow at a rate of 
15% annually. Despite this growth, 33% of organic food products are found to be 
fraudulently mislabelled, according to the European Union and the USDA. 
 This lack of trust and transparency leads to an inefficient, exploitative supply chain that 
harms both farmers and consumers. 
Target Audience: 
 Farmers: Practitioners of natural and organic farming, especially in developing regions like 
India and Southeast Asia, who need fair market access. 
 Consumers: Health-conscious individuals, primarily from urban areas, who prioritize 
authenticity and traceability in the products they buy. 
Solution Overview 
Brief Explanation: 
AgriChain is a blockchain-based marketplace that brings together natural farmers and conscious 
consumers in a way that guarantees authenticity, traceability, and fair pricing. Our solution uses 
blockchain technology to authenticate natural farming practices and implements a QR code system 
that provides consumers with real-time information about the origin, farming methods, and 
certifications of each product. 
Approach: 
 Blockchain for Authenticity: Leverage blockchain’s tamper-proof features to provide a 
transparent, verifiable record of a farmer’s certification status. 
 Real-Time Traceability: Consumers scan QR codes on products to instantly access data about 
product origins, farming methods, and certifications. 
 Direct Market Connection: Create a digital marketplace that connects verified natural 
farmers directly with consumers, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair pricing. 
Uniqueness: 
Existing platforms like Farmigo and FarmDrop provide market access for farmers but lack the level of 
verification and transparency needed to build consumer trust. Our solution is unique because we 
use blockchain for real-time product verification and traceability, providing consumers and farmers 
with guaranteed transparency. 
Frameworks/Technologies 
 Blockchain Technology (Ethereum or Hyperledger) for immutable, transparent verification. 
 React Native for mobile app development to ensure cross-platform compatibility. 
 Cloud Hosting (AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability and security. 
 QR Code System for product traceability. 
Reasoning: 
 Blockchain offers the highest level of security and transparency, which is vital for verifying 
certifications and farming practices. 
 React Native enables us to reach a larger audience with a single codebase, reducing 
development costs. 
 Cloud Hosting provides scalable infrastructure, allowing the system to grow with user 
demand. 
 QR Codes are easy to implement, and they offer immediate access to product history and 
certifications. 
Assumptions & Constraints: 
 Assumes internet access for consumers in rural areas. 
 Initial focus will be on pilot regions to test the platform’s feasibility and scalability. 
 Regulatory challenges around certifications may require close collaboration with authorities. 
Feasibility and Implementation 
 Implementation Ease: 
The development process is divided into phases: 
o Phase 1 (0-3 months): Develop blockchain-based verification and integrate QR code 
systems. 
o Phase 2 (3-6 months): Build the mobile app and initiate pilot testing with a select 
group of farmers. 
o Phase 3 (6-12 months): Expand the platform to include more farmers and launch 
consumer-focused marketing campaigns. 
 Effectiveness: 
AgriChain addresses the core problems of market access and product authenticity. The 
blockchain solution ensures that consumers can verify products’ origins and certifications, 
while the direct market connection ensures fair pricing and transparent transactions. 
UI/UX Mockup 
 Screens Overview: 
o Home Screen: A simple, user-friendly interface where consumers can search for 
products and scan QR codes. 
o Product Page: Includes product details, origin, farming methods, and a QR code for 
traceability. 
o Farmer Profile: Verified natural farming practices, certifications, and product listings. 
 User Flow: 
1. Consumers scan the product QR code to verify authenticity. 
2. They review information about the product’s origin, farming methods, and 
certification status. 
3. Consumers can directly purchase the product from the farmer’s verified 
profile. 
 Accessibility Considerations: 
The platform will feature adjustable text sizes and high contrast colors to ensure 
accessibility for all users, including those with visual impairments. 
Business Scope and Use Case 
 Use Case Scenarios: 
o Farmers: Upload product details, certifications, and farming practices to blockchain. 
o Consumers: Scan a product’s QR code to view its farming history and certification 
status in real-time. 
 Market Need: 
The global organic food market is growing rapidly, with demand for traceable, sustainable, 
and authentic products increasing. According to a report by Nielsen, 73% of consumers say 
they would pay more for products with clear and credible sustainability credentials. 
 Revenue Model: 
o Transaction Fees: We charge a small fee for each transaction processed through the 
marketplace. 
o Subscription Model: Farmers pay for additional services such as premium 
placement or expanded product listings. 
System Design and Architecture 
 Technologies Overview: 
o Blockchain: Provides a secure, tamper-proof ledger for farmer verification and 
product traceability. 
o Cloud Hosting: Ensures scalability and high availability as the platform grows. 
o React Native: Used for developing the mobile app, ensuring cross-platform 
compatibility. 
 Design Patterns: 
o Microservices architecture to allow for modular development and easy scaling. 
o MVC Pattern to separate application logic, ensuring the code remains clean and 
maintainable. 
 Functional Flow: 
A consumer visits the marketplace, scans a product’s QR code, and is directed to the product 
details, which include verified farming practices and certification history on blockchain. 
Coding Approach 
 Development Strategy: 
Using Agile methodology for rapid iteration and testing. Features will be rolled out in 
phases, with a strong focus on feedback-driven development. 
 Coding Standards: 
Adhering to best practices such as code reviews, unit testing, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure 
quality and efficiency.
